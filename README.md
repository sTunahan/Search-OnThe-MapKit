# Search_onThe_MapKit

Within the specified area, a place is searched according to our search word.

It makes use of the MKLocalSearch.Request() class.

Within the venue results, we also get information about the venue.

Mapkit.FrameWork was used for its use. Import MapKit was done in ViewController.

NOTE: The location information is not only used to show on the Map, but if we need to use it in another place, we can use it there.
